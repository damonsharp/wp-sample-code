# Sample WordPress Code #

A sampling of WordPress code for review, which contains the following:

- A proof of concept shortcode lead generation plugin.
- A Sass file.
- Some OOO PHP class files from a companion plugin built to support theme functionality for website I previously built for monarchbaseball.org, including integrating Fieldmanager for building admin meta boxes, etc.
- JS for processing a contact form using ES6, fetch, etc.
- PHP class for obtaining tweets from the Twitter API.
- Widget for displaying the information obtained from Twitter.
- Other general code.
